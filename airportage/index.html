          <h1>For example, we will take the Sydney airport (I will refer to it by its IATA code SYD). Lets say, you get a fake ID (<a href="https://yla.org.au/nsw/topics/courts-police-and-the-law/fake-id-cards/">protected by NSW law</a>). For now, there is no biometric identification, so you'd be fine as long as the fake is good. However, in whatever country you are arriving in, there is a 67% chance that they have fingerprint identification. This is unlikely if you don't fly to the US.</h1>
